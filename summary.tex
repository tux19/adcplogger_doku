\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}
In the course of this software project, a modular application to parse ADCP data was designed and developed for General Acoustics e.K residing in Kiel, Germany. The design was guided by requirements posed by General Acoustics e.K. . The result of the design was a component based ADCP parser built upon a threaded architecture to enhance scalability. The design is flexible and allows the addition of new components to add functionality. The application features as basic functionality the possibility of real-time data parsing on incoming data on a serial port as well as the ability to parse old ADCP data files. The architecture resulted in a three threaded base frame where every thread executes one component.\\
The implementation was done in modern C++11, new optimizing features like move semantics were used intensively. Each component was developed as independent as possible to decouple the whole system and raise the reuse ability. The Boost C++ libraries were used to simplify the development and allow complete portability of the code.
