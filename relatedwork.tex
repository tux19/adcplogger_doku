\chapter{Related Work}
This chapter presents the related work on which this project will be built on. The basis will be the work done at General Acoustics e.K. particularly from Dipl. Ing. Jan Schirrmacher in previous projects containing an ADCP. Afterwards a in-depth introduction on the used ADCP from Rowe Technologies, Inc. will provide the needed background information. Finally the used external libraries will be presented with according alternatives and reasoning about the decisions.

\section{General Acoustics e.K.}
Due to previous projects with ADCP's a lot of knowledge was allready available from General Acoustics e.K. I was able to look at the algorithms of the current ADCP parser as well as other libraries used in this context. The libraries were developed by Jan Schirrmacher in Delphi and thus only available for Windows.\\

\section{ADCP - Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler}
An Acoustic Doppler current profiler is a system for measuring current velocities using coded-pulse broadband acoustic signals. Autocorrelation of two phase coded pulses which are in the water during a single transmission cycle is used to calculate a Doppler frequency [1].
