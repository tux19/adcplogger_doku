  \item[bin] Bins are the discreet values where the ADCP measures the flow. In this project a bin has the hight of 0.5 m.
  \item[beam] An ADCP has a finite number of beams. Beams emit the waves used to measure the flow currents and directions. At least 3 beams have to be available to be able to measure the direction of the flow.
  \item[ADCP ensemble] An ADCP ensemble contains all data of one measuring ping. The data is stored in a series of MATLAB matrices.
  \item[ADCP frame] An ADCP frame is essentially an ensemble with a header at the beginning and a CRC checksum at the end. The ADCP sends out frames. The frame header and the checksum allow error detection.
  \item[ADCP burst] A collection of a number ADCP frames measured continuously. In this project a burst contains 2048 frames collected over around 6-7 minutes.
