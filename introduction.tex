\section{Motivation}
As part of my bachelor degree course in softwaresystems I had to complete a three month informatics internship at an organisation of my choice. I did the internship in the summer 2015 at General Acoustics e.K. located in Kiel, Germany. General Acoustics e.K. is specialized at producing leading edge echo-sounders, water level- and wave sensors as well as flow measuring systems. They are primarily using remote sensing technologies especially ultrasound based technologies. Apart from the hardware General Acoustics e.K. also accordingly provides specialized software to provide a complete customer experience.\\
In these three month of internship I helped in the developement of a database solution to store, process and visualize environemental sensor data from an offshore platform located in the Iraq. The internship was very successful for both sides, thus resulting in my further involvement in their work. The good cooperation with General Acpoustics e.K. made it possible to do this software project.\\\newline%notsogood TODO\\ 
The most imprtant and complex sensor on the iraqi platform is an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) which measures the flow direction and velocity of the water at different hights. It operates at around 3Hz and produces a lot of data, a big part of it currently not important for our analysis. In the preset situation all data gets logged on the platform, and is later transmitted onshore. On the onshore server the incomming data is parsed, processed and then stored in a database. Problems rise due to the unreliable communication between platform and onshore server caused by regular power outages. The amount of data produced by the ADCP is too high to be logged over a long time and lead in the past to data loss.\\\newline
To prevent such inconveniences in future projects General Acoustics e.K. decided to move some of the data-processing activities onto the offshore platfom. Besides the experience in current projects, the decision was also driven by possible upcoming projects where multiple platforms will be managed from a central station. This move implicated that the logger has to be more powerful, it should be able to parse and process the incoming data in real time as well as being able to run other services like a small database. In the future the logger should be able to offer a stand-alone experience of the measuring Platform respectively measuring station.\\\newline
The goal of this software project is the implementation of a modular parser for ADCP data. The resulting software will be the foundation of the concept above, it should be easily extendable to support other sensors and data processing and analysis methods.
